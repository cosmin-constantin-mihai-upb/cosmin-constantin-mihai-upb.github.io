## Using graphics processing units and openGL in adaptive-robust real time control
### ECAI 2020
#### Co Authors: Ciprian Lupu, Andrei-Alexandru Vulpe

<p> A complementary approach to implementing high performance real time adaptive robust multi model control systems is presented which leverages the power of graphics processing units to implement a cache of previously discovered models and controllers, which will improve the efficiency of the control loop if the system has a repeated behavior, or the process encounters several similar types of perturbances.</p>

### EMES 2017
#### Co Authors: Ciprian Lupu, Dan Secuianu, Andrei-Alexandru Vulpe
<p> Describes the implementation of high performance process simulator clusters based on modern graphical processing unit architectures.</p>
