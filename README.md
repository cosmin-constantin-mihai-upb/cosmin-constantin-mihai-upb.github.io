## Using graphics processing units and openGL in adaptive-robust real time control
### ECAI 2020
#### Co Authors: Ciprian Lupu, Andrei-Alexandru Vulpe

<p> A complementary approach to implementing high performance real time adaptive robust multi model control systems is presented which leverages the power of graphics processing units to implement a cache of previously discovered models and controllers, which will improve the efficiency of the control loop if the system has a repeated behavior, or the process encounters several similar types of perturbances.</p>

## Implementing high performance system simulators using modern graphics rendering devices: Implementing system control algorithms on graphics hardware
### EMES 2017
#### Co Authors: Ciprian Lupu, Dan Secuianu, Andrei-Alexandru Vulpe
<p> Describes the implementation of high performance process simulator clusters based on modern graphical processing unit architectures.</p>

# Real Time & Power Efficient Adaptive - Robust Control
### Journal of Physics Conference 2017
#### Co Authors: Lavinius Ioan Gliga, Ciprian Lupu, Dumitru Popescu
<p> A design procedure for a control system suited for dynamic variable processes is presented in this paper. The proposed adaptive - robust control strategy considers both adaptive control advantages and robust control benefits.</p>

## Adaptive - Robust control a computational efficient real time simulation
### EMES 2015
#### Co Authors: Lavinius Ioan Gliga, Ciprian Lupu, Dumitru Popescu
<p> The adaptive-robust control strategy, proposed in this paper, combines the advantages of robust and adaptive control, while minimizing the computational load.</p>

## Actual portable devices as base for telemedicine and e-health: Research and case study application
### EBH 2013
#### Co Authors: Ciprian Lupu
<p> Present paper presents an application designed to help paramedics or other intervention personal to diagnose and monitor the state of victims in remote or difficult to access areas using Windows 8 tablet computers. The application is written in Visual C# and uses the latest programming technologies and security features. It will help measure the Glasgow Coma Scale, respiration, pulse, blood pressure of victims and pass on data to a remote centralized management system using wireless signals, such as wireless internet and Bluetooth.</p>
